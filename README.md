Full stack test


# Technical Test

The goal of this test is to evaluate your ability:
- to create a small Angular/Ionic app,
- to setup a small PHP API,
- to produce elegant code.

## Instructions

Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to create a small app (angular4 or Ionic3) displaying a restaurant menu, fed by a (small) PHP REST API.

### Frontend

Build a nice looking, relevant & fast app displaying a restaurant menu with the following abilities
- Add product to cart
- Remove product from cart
- Display the number of products in the cart

The menu should be fetched from your backend.


### Backend
Build (from scratch) the **smallest** MVC framework able to route an HTTP query and send the response.
You do not need a database, static data will do.
Your backend should only have one endpoint:
- `GET /menu` => Returns a JSON object with the content of the menu

## Evaluation criterias

- The quality of your code. We love elegant code.
- The architecture of your framework.
- UI & UX of the restaurant menu
- And, of course, you can go the extra mile and add more features!

Your code should be pushed to a public GitHub repository. There is no time limit. Take your time, and do your best.

Good luck :-)
